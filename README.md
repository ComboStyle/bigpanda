# Frontend Exercise Backend

## Instructions
1. `npm install`
2. you may need to `npm install -g webpack` (if you get an error that webpack wasn't found)
3. `npm run build` OR `npm run watch` (if you want to play with the code)
4. `npm start`

## Notes
* I intentionally left the `console.logs(...)` if you want to look deeper into it
* I wanted you to have enough time to review so I haven't finished all the CSS stuff I wanted to do
* Thanks :)
